Are you a Rust developer working in an environment with limited or [no internet access](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/developing-with-rust-offline/8679)? Are you struggling to manage Rust toolchains and dependencies on a Windows machine under these constraints? If so, the `RustInstallHelper` class is here to save the day!

## Introduction

The `RustInstallHelper` is a powerful, user-friendly tool designed to assist developers working offline or in environments with restricted internet access. It provides a set of static methods that mimic the behavior of essential Rust toolchain management functions, helping you overcome the challenges faced by developers like Mark, who posted the question on Stack Overflow.

## Problems We Solve

### 1. Installing Rust Toolchains

Many developers, especially beginners, face difficulties installing Rust toolchains on machines with no internet access. The `RustInstallHelper` class simplifies this process, allowing you to install and manage Rust toolchains with ease.

```powershell
[RustInstallHelper]::InstallRustToolchain("1.53.0")
```

### 2. Managing Rust Dependencies

Managing dependencies is a critical aspect of Rust development. `RustInstallHelper` provides methods to assist you in managing dependencies locally.

```powershell
[RustInstallHelper]::InstallCargoDependencies("my_crate")
```

### 3. Installing Rust Proxies

If you require Rust proxies for your offline development, the `RustInstallHelper` class can help you install and configure them effortlessly.

```powershell
[RustInstallHelper]::InstallRustProxies()
```

### 4. Simplified Project Building

The class also simplifies building Rust projects, ensuring that your projects are compiled correctly and efficiently.

```powershell
[RustInstallHelper]::BuildRustProject("my_project")
```

### 5. Exception Handling

Handling errors gracefully is crucial. `RustInstallHelper` includes error-handling methods to address issues without halting your workflow.

```powershell
try {
    [RustInstallHelper]::InstallRustToolchain("1.53.0")
} catch {
    Write-Host "An error occurred: $_"
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
