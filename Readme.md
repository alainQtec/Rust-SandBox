# Rust Sandbox

> Some fundamental syntax of the Rust language.

## Quick Start

Un-comment the file function to run

``` bash
# Run With Cargo
cargo run

# Build
cargo build

# Build for production
cargo build --release
```

## Notes

All branches Ending in .rs are completely separate repos/projects (They can't be merged into the main)

Its just convinient this way since this is a practice / playground repo, so I keep all projects in this same repo, but on different branches.

## [Crates](https://crates.io/)

Most of these small Projects are [cli tools](https://crates.io/categories/command-line-utilities)
